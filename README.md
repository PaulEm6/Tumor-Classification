# Tumor-Classification

Welcome to the Tumor-Classification project! In this repository, we focus on the classification of MRI images of brain tumors. Our goal is to determine whether an MRI scan contains a type of tumor or no tumor at all.

## Overview

This project involves training and evaluating three different models to classify MRI images:
1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
2. Random Forest
3. Transfer Learning Model

We employ data augmentation techniques and hyperparameter tuning to achieve the best possible results.
